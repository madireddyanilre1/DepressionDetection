Depression Detection Using EEG Signals
Depression is a widespread mental health disorder that affects millions of individuals globally. Early and accurate detection of depression is essential for timely intervention and effective treatment.
Our system utilizes deep learning techniques, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and machine learning techniques such as SVM, to identify and categorize depression acivities.
We are using deep learning CNN algorithm to predict depression from EEG signals dataset. Now-a-days humans are more prone to depression due to competitive environment in all fields and timely detection of depression can help humans in recovering faster.
